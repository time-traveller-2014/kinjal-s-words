I see you and I feel you too. It's like there's nothing particularly wrong but nothing seems alright. You feel tired even after resting for more than needed. You don't feel like getting on with your days. Each morning you fight the demons to get out of the bed. You carry on with your routine on autopilot. You do what you have to and nothing else.
You don't feel like eating anything and especially when you're alone, you don't feel like cooking something for yourself. So, you get in your bed and just lay there.
Your body feels so weak that you don't want to move an inch. You want to share it with someone but it feels overwhelming and draining to express it. So, you just doom scroll through the social media. Unable to sleep you stare at the ceiling and start wondering where it all went wrong! You're where you once wanted to be but you feel like you're stuck here for so long. There's nothing new happening. You can feel your inner self screaming at you to get the shit together but somehow you're unable to. There's this ache in your chest and a heaviness that is unexplainable. You feel distant from people and reality. You know that you have everything you once wished for but somehow you feel so much pain and you didn't even know the reason for it. You see people struggling around you and you instantly invalidate your pain and feelings. Just because they are having it bad. You try to find a reason why you feel all that pain but unfortunately nothing resurfaces.
But hey, let me remind you that just because you see someone struggling more than you doesn't mean your pain is less. You are allowed to feel off. You are not broken, you are not weak. You are human. So, please stop comparing your pain and struggle with others. Maybe you just need a moment to pause. Maybe you just need to take a few deep breaths. Maybe you just need to feel seen.

So if you're reading this and thinking, "this is me"-
Then I wrote this for you.
You are not alone, I see you. I promise!
