The thing about happiness is—it lies in little moments.
It’s not constant, and it never will be.
Collect the pieces while you still can.

Little happy moments can look like:
— Seeing your pup after a long week
— Walking after a busy day
— Listening to music after being so tired
— A quiet cup of coffee
— Sitting alone with a book
— Enjoying your meal
— Having chocolate or ice cream

Anything that slows down time and brings you ease—
That is happiness.

Those moments bring you back to peace.
The little moments when you forget the track of time...
Those are the moments you’d want to feel.

You might not notice it, but your heart is at peace
And your mind is at rest—
You’re fully present.

Focus on those moments.
They’re the ones you’ll remember—
On a random fine day,
When you’ve become who you always wanted to be.

Enjoy those little moments.
Your life lies in them.
Your life will be the collection of each one—
And nothing else.
