    <h1>Things You Will Feel in Your 20s</h1>

    <div class="quote-block">
      <p>1. You will be surrounded by the people you love and the people who love you, but at times you’ll still feel lonely. There will be moments when you won’t relate to anything—and those will be hard. Be gentle with yourself. Trust yourself. Have faith. And most importantly, be patient. If you're taking care of yourself, that’s enough. You will make it through.</p>

      <p>2. You’ll often feel confused—even about the things and people you love. You’ll question your smallest daily decisions and your biggest life-changing ones. You’ll worry about what to eat for dinner and whether you chose the right career. Let yourself trust the journey. Even the things that don’t work out will gently lead you to what’s meant for you.</p>

      <p>3. Sometimes, silence will feel like the only option. You won’t want to explain yourself. You’ll crave stillness, solitude. That is okay. But remember—solitude should heal you, not hollow you. Let the people around you know. Let them in, even if only a little. They care more than you think.</p>

      <p>4. The most important thing you can learn: to trust yourself—deeply, unshakably. Be your biggest supporter. Your safest place. One day, the people you love, and those who love you, may need to go. Life changes. Learn to be okay with that. You’ll never be alone if you learn how to stand by yourself.</p>
